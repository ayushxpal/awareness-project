        <h2>Awareness about Solar Panels</h2>
        <p>Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. They are made up of many solar cells, which work together to generate electricity when exposed to sunlight.</p>
        <p>Benefits of solar panels include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clean Energy:</strong> Solar energy is renewable and produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, helping to combat climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> By generating your own electricity, you can reduce or even eliminate your electricity bills, saving money in the long run.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Independence:</strong> Solar panels provide a source of energy that is independent of the utility grid, giving you more control over your energy consumption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some Indian government resources where you can find more information about solar energy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://mnre.gov.in/">Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)</a> - The official government ministry responsible for promoting renewable energy sources including solar energy in India.</li>
            <li><a href="https://solarrooftop.gov.in/">Solar Rooftop Portal</a> - A platform initiated by the Indian government to promote rooftop solar installations for households, commercial buildings, and industries.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.seci.co.in/">Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI)</a> - A public sector undertaking dedicated to facilitating the implementation of various government schemes related to solar energy.</li>
